SnoozeMuze -- Android Noise Machine Application
==========

	My First Android Programming Project. A Noise Machine App. 
I created this app because I was having some trouble sleeping,
that is honestly where the inspiration came from. That is why
the objective of it is to play background noise on loop until
shut off.

	This essentially is a very simple app, there are five buttons and 
a slider in the UI. The three white buttons below the picture can 
be used to controll what sound is being played, and whether it is 
being played. The left most and right most buttons are previous 
and next buttons, they will stop the current sound and bring the 
user to the next sound and picture. 

	The middle button is a play button,when clicked it will 
play the sound displayed in the picture,being forest sounds, rain,
public food court, or beach. It will play until clicked again. 
The image itself can be clicked as well and will start and stop the sound. 
In the top left there is a volume slider that will change the volume at
which the noise is outputted at.

	The credits button in the top right is where I give credit
to the sources that I used to help create this project. The
sound should loop while in this menu as well.

	There shouldn't be any problems compiling this, I have 
extended Activity therefore no external librarys should be necessary.
Note I have only tested this with API level 19 devices, but lint does
not give me any warnings saying that it will not on lower devices.

Thanks for reading!
